            "description": "Школа информационных технологий и инженерии – это прежде всего семья единомышленников, цель которой принести еще больше счастья и удовольствия обществу через образование: чтобы каждый год в интеллектуальной прослойке общества становилось на несколько сот больше молодежи, которая умеет принимать ответственные решения для благополучия своих семей, для компаний, в которых они работают, и в целом для общества. Миссия ШИТиИ, которую поддерживают члены нашей семьи - студенты и сотрудники школы - сделать мир лучше, в том числе и через ИТ образование. С этой целью и мечтой (которая сбывается!) ШИТиИ живет с момента своего основания в 2002 году. В разные периоды времени нивелировались задачи для достижения цели - и это естественно: жизнь меняется быстротечно, а скорости изменений в обществе, особенно в технологиях настолько велики, что казавшееся нам фантастикой еще 50 лет назад, сегодня уже реальность, в разработке которой участвует порою молодежь школьного возраста. На сегодня ШИТиИ – это самая большая школа КБТУ, в которой получают образовательные услуги более чем две тысячи студентов бакалавров, магистров и докторантов. Существуют несколько составляющих в жизни школы, на которых опирается успех в решении задач для достижения цели. Нам представляются эти составляющие таковыми: 1. Окружение (атмосфера) 2. Образовательные программы 3. Преподавательский состав 4. Техническое оснащение (лаборатории) 5. Связь с индустрией 6. Научно-прикладные исследования. Каждая из этих составляющих вносит свой значительный вклад в достижение цели. В отсутствии какой-либо из составляющих нам вряд ли удалось бы добиться тех достижений, которыми гордится КБТУ и вся страна. А достижения поистине впечатляют.",
            "mission": " Благодаря продвижению и распространению знаний, технических ноу-хау и повышению квалификации ШИТиИ будет способствовать экономическому росту и процветанию. Мы будем способствовать созданию социального и культурного взаимопонимания на местном и глобальном уровнях путем подготовки социально сознательных и ответственных граждан. Мы позаботимся о том, чтобы молодые мужчины и женщины, прошедшие обучение в ШИТИИ, были высококвалифицированными, опытными и компетентными профессионалами. Эти интеллектуально и технически способные люди станут достоянием глобального общества знаний.",

Для реализации и поддержания целей в области качества профессорско-преподавательский состав Университета ставит перед собой следующие цели: 1. Обеспечить конкурентоспособность выпускников в сфере образования в Казахстане и в мире за счет повышения качества образовательных услуг и соответствия международным стандартам технического высшего образования. 2. Оказывать поддержку устойчивому росту научно-исследовательской деятельности ППС, мотивировать к повышению их образования, научной квалификации, путем организации и проведения конференций и посещения семинаров и курсов. 3. Интегрироваться в мировой образовательный процесс путем налаживания взаимовыгодного сотрудничества с ведущими зарубежными университетами, а также международными поставщиками программного и аппаратного обеспечения для установления связей, направленных на повышение общего качества ИТ-специалистов. 4. Привлечение студентов и участников ВУЗов к научно-исследовательской и проектной инициативе путем повышения качества участия студента в проектных конкурсах и конкурсах, инновационных проектах за счет использования исследовательской инфраструктуры КБТУ, участия в различных местных и международных олимпиадах по программированию. 5. Обеспечить качество образования за счет улучшения кадрового поиска, привлечения одаренных студентов из различных ведущих вузов Казахстана и зарубежья, увеличения количества образовательных университетских (внутренних, негосударственных) стипендий или освобождений от платы за обучение для талантливых студентов.",
